                                    Explanatory example: match Valencia and Sevilla finished 2-1 for Valencia
                                        
                                        If your expectation is 2-1 for Valencia, it is a "careful" expectation for the winning side and score and you get 3 points
                                        
                                        If you expect Valencia to win any other result other than 2-1, expect you to be "right" only because you expected the winning side and get one point (1)
                                        
                                        If you expect to win Sevilla or draw a "wrong" expectation and deducted from you point (-1)

                                <h6>4 - What is the feature of Joker in a tactic contest and what is its usefulness?</h6>
                                <li>The Joker feature doubles your points if you expect the match accurately (ie you expected the exact result and you have a Joker on the game) you get 5 points instead of 3
                                        
                                        You can use the Joker on one match each round in each tournament, ie Joker for the Spanish, Joker for Italian, Joker for English and Joker for Champions

                                        You can not delete the Joker after choosing it, but you can change the place and put it on another match easily, by filling the option Joker on another match and press the amendment at your new option is saved Joker on the new game.

                                <li>
                                        You do not need to expect a league champion. You should expect the results of matches available on the Predictions page every week to the end of the season to get the maximum number of points that entitle you to compete.

                                        To compete you have to collect the largest number of points and therefore you should expect all the games available because everyone will expect all the matches available and exceed you in the ranking,
                                        
                                        But the subject is not compulsory if you forget to expect a certain match will be calculated the rest of your expectations without problems.
                                        
                                        Note that the competition includes only 6 teams of each league in addition to all matches of the Champions League, that the number of matches is not large and the excitement guaranteed

                                        But the main competition TACTIC90 includes all competitions (Spanish, Italian, English and Champions League), so you should expect all matches in all leagues to compete in the main monthly and seasonal competition TACTIC90
